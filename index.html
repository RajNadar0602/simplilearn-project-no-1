            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">The laws of physics are manifested everywhere in nature.
                Consider a flowing river: it obeys physical laws and, in effect, solves complex fluid 
                dynamics equations as it flows from one point to another. The laws of physics are always
                at work, but are not being harnessed in a programmable way. A river, of course, is not 
                considered to be a computer.
                 <br>Flowing rivers and all other natural phenomena constantly obey the laws of physics, but 
                only some types of physics are being harnessed in computation. Consider the following examples.</br>

               </p>
            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">The most well-known example of a computer, digital computers harness
                 the physics of electromagnetism where they receive instructions as electrical signals. The discrete
                 on (1) or off (0) signals are represented by binary digits—also known as bits. Sequences of bits are
                 processed and results can be stored or returned. Whatever instructions are input or programming 
                 language is used, the result is the same—it is just bits to the computer.
             <br>Digital computers are built using transistors which are semiconductor devices that amplify and 
                 switch electronic signals and are used to represent bits. If the voltage running through a transistor
                 is high enough, it is interpreted as being ‘on’, otherwise it is considered ‘off’.</br>

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Humans are programmable: our brains operate by harnessing biophysical 
                     processes to receive instructions,process information, and output results. The human brain is considered
                     to be the most complex object in the universe, containing hundreds of billions of neurons, and trillions
                    of synapses connecting the neurons.
                    <br>One could say the human brain is by far the best computer out there, even capable of creating other 
                     kinds of computers. In fact, the concept of a computer was first used to describe humans who performed 
                     calculations by hand.</br>
                    <br>A famous example of human computers involves a team of women at NASA. They made important calculations,
                     including how many rockets are required to make a plane airborne, the thrust-to-weight ratio for various 
                     aircraft, and trajectory computations for rocket launches. These calculations often filled up several notebooks
                     with data and formulas. These human computers made important contributions to aeronautics and the space program.</br>

            </p>
            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Quantum mechanics started with the idea that the state of a physical system, such
                 as an atom, is described by discrete levels known as quanta. Light itself was shown to be made up of discrete 
                 packets known as photons, where the energy of a photon is proportional to its frequency. These principles were first
                 verified in the photoelectric effect, described in detail by Albert Einstein in 1905.
              <br>The idea of quantization started a revolution in physics that has been the subject of intense research for over a
                  century and has resulted in many applications including the laser, magnetic resonance imaging, electron microscopy, 
                  and materials innovation by means of quantum simulation.</br>
               <br>In 1982, physicist Richard Feynman proposed the idea of harnessing quantum systems themselves as a powerful way of
                   performing quantum simulation. This proposal is widely viewed as the inception of quantum computing.</br>
                <br>Quantum computing involves information processing by harnessing tiny quantum systems, called quantum bits—or, qubits.
                   Qubits exhibit behaviour that seems exotic or weird on our macroscopic scale: quantum superposition, entanglement, and
                   the unavoidable fact that observable quantities in quantum mechanics are based on probabilities. These features are all
                   contained in the equations of motion in quantum mechanics, the most famous example being the Schrödinger equation.</br>
                <br>In creating quantum algorithms based on qubits, promising applications arose including quantum cryptography and 
                    improved optimization methods. These applications, together with simulating quantum systems, are the major drivers behind
                     the quantum computing movement.</br>
