            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">The laws of physics are manifested everywhere in nature.
                Consider a flowing river: it obeys physical laws and, in effect, solves complex fluid
                dynamics equations as it flows from one point to another. The laws of physics are always
                at work, but are not being harnessed in a programmable way. A river, of course, is not
                considered to be a computer.
                <br>Flowing rivers and all other natural phenomena constantly obey the laws of physics, but
                only some types of physics are being harnessed in computation. Consider the following examples.</br>

            </p>
            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">The most well-known example of a computer, digital computers harness
                the physics of electromagnetism where they receive instructions as electrical signals. The discrete
                on (1) or off (0) signals are represented by binary digits—also known as bits. Sequences of bits are
                processed and results can be stored or returned. Whatever instructions are input or programming
                language is used, the result is the same—it is just bits to the computer.
                <br>Digital computers are built using transistors which are semiconductor devices that amplify and
                switch electronic signals and are used to represent bits. If the voltage running through a transistor
                is high enough, it is interpreted as being ‘on’, otherwise it is considered ‘off’.</br>

            <h2>2. Human Computation</h2>
            </p>
            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Humans are programmable: our brains operate by harnessing biophysical
                processes to receive instructions,process information, and output results. The human brain is considered
                to be the most complex object in the universe, containing hundreds of billions of neurons, and trillions
                of synapses connecting the neurons.
                <br>One could say the human brain is by far the best computer out there, even capable of creating other
                kinds of computers. In fact, the concept of a computer was first used to describe humans who performed
                calculations by hand.</br>
                <br>A famous example of human computers involves a team of women at NASA. They made important
                calculations,
                including how many rockets are required to make a plane airborne, the thrust-to-weight ratio for various
                aircraft, and trajectory computations for rocket launches. These calculations often filled up several
                notebooks
                with data and formulas. These human computers made important contributions to aeronautics and the space
                program.</br>

            <h2>3. Quantum Computation</h2>
            </p>
            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Quantum mechanics started with the idea that the state of a physical
                system, such
                as an atom, is described by discrete levels known as quanta. Light itself was shown to be made up of
                discrete
                packets known as photons, where the energy of a photon is proportional to its frequency. These
                principles were first
                verified in the photoelectric effect, described in detail by Albert Einstein in 1905.
                <br>The idea of quantization started a revolution in physics that has been the subject of intense
                research for over a
                century and has resulted in many applications including the laser, magnetic resonance imaging, electron
                microscopy,
                and materials innovation by means of quantum simulation.</br>
                <br>In 1982, physicist Richard Feynman proposed the idea of harnessing quantum systems themselves as a
                powerful way of
                performing quantum simulation. This proposal is widely viewed as the inception of quantum
                computing.</br>
                <br>Quantum computing involves information processing by harnessing tiny quantum systems, called quantum
                bits—or, qubits.
                Qubits exhibit behaviour that seems exotic or weird on our macroscopic scale: quantum superposition,
                entanglement, and
                the unavoidable fact that observable quantities in quantum mechanics are based on probabilities. These
                features are all
                contained in the equations of motion in quantum mechanics, the most famous example being the Schrödinger
                equation.</br>
                <br>In creating quantum algorithms based on qubits, promising applications arose including quantum
                cryptography and
                improved optimization methods. These applications, together with simulating quantum systems, are the
                major drivers behind
                the quantum computing movement.</br>
